<b>Review</b>

The code suggestions provided by Copilot are often accurate and helpful, allowing me to write code more efficiently. It can generate code for various programming languages and frameworks, which is convenient when working on different projects with diverse tech stacks.

One of the notable features of Copilot is its ability to understand the intent of my code and generate contextually relevant suggestions. It adapts to my coding style and learns from my codebase, which improves the accuracy of its suggestions over time.

However, being a new user, there are instances where Copilot's suggestions may not be precisely what I intended or may not align with the coding standards of the project. In such cases, I need to review and modify the generated code accordingly.
